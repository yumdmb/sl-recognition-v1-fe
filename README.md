# SignBridge - Sign Language Recognition Platform

SignBridge is a comprehensive web application designed to help users learn, recognize, and contribute to sign language. The platform supports both American Sign Language (ASL) and Malaysian Sign Language (MSL) with a range of features focused on accessibility and education.

This application is developed as a Final Year Project in collaboration with Dr. Anthony Chong from The Malaysian Sign Language and Deaf Studies National Organisation (MyBIM). The project aims to bridge communication gaps and make sign language learning more accessible through modern technology.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- PNPM (recommended) or npm
- Supabase account for database and authentication

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd signlanguage-recognition-v1-fe
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Set up Supabase:
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Initialize Supabase (if not already done)
supabase init

# Start local Supabase (optional for local development)
supabase start

# Apply migrations to your Supabase project
supabase db push
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Database Setup

The project includes comprehensive database migrations in the `supabase/migrations/` directory that set up:
- User profiles and authentication
- Learning modules (tutorials, materials, quizzes)
- Gesture recognition and contributions
- Forum and chat systems
- Proficiency testing
- Avatar generation storage

Run the migrations using the Supabase CLI or apply them directly in the Supabase SQL Editor.
